<p class="intro">
    <a href="http://isis.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Isis</a>&trade; is a platform to let you rapidly develop
    domain-driven apps in Java.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This app has been generated using Apache Isis'
    <a href="http://isis.apache.org/intro/getting-started/simple%61pp-archetype.html" target="_blank">SimpleApp</a> archetype,
    to create a purposefully minimal application that nevertheless includes fixture data, integration tests and BDD specs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The app itself consists of a single domain class, <a href="https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/example/application/simple%61pp/dom/src/main/java/dom/simple/SimpleObject.java"  target="_blank"><tt>SimpleObject</tt></a>,
    along with an equally simple (factory/repository) domain service, <a href="https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/example/application/simple%61pp/dom/src/main/java/dom/simple/SimpleObjects.java"  target="_blank"><tt>SimpleObjects</tt></a>.
    <br/>
